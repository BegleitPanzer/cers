# CERS: A Memory Browser & Editor
CERS is a TUI memory browser and editor, strongly inspired by Cheat Engine and written in Rust (you can guess what CERS means). This is a passion project I took up for the sake of better understanding how memory truly works.

### Roadmap:
- [x] Integer Scanning
- [x] Float Scanning
- [x] String Scanning
- [ ] More Scan Types
- [x] Better Scan Speed
- [ ] Better Scan Speed (2.0)
- [ ] Proper Settings Menu
