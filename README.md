# CERS: A Memory Browser & Editor
CERS is a TUI memory browser and editor, strongly inspired by Cheat Engine and written in Rust (you can guess what CERS means). This is a passion project I took up for the sake of better understanding how memory truly works.

### Roadmap:
- [x] Integer Scanning
- [] Float Scanning
- [] String Scanning
- [] More Scan Types
- [] Better Scan Speed
- [] Proper Settings Menu

more to come :)
